I have a passion for learning and growing, and I am always studying new ways to improve my skills as a developer. My strengths lie in analytical abilities and problem-solving, with a demonstrated ability to manage multiple priorities in an agile development environment.
I define technical strategies for executing analysis with a data science perspective.
